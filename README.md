## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use the background-image tag using an url to show the image.

I learned to use media queries.

### Continued development

Now I know that I should use the <picture> tag instead of the <img> or the <background-image> because the <picture> tag is responsive and SEO friendly.
